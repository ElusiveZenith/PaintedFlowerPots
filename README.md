# Painted Flower Pots - Minecraft Data Pack
Why there aren't already painted flower pots in Minecraft is crazy. This is a Data Pack that adds them to the game.
Tested for Minecraft 1.19.4

How to craft:
Limitations in vinella prevent crafting with additional data, so to get, place a vinella flower pot into your world, then break it while holding the dye you want to use in your promary hand. The painted verson of the flower pot will drop and you can place it in your world as normal.

How it works:
The colored flower pots are item frames that have custom data and models which are placed in invisable item frames. There is a normal flower pot that is plased at the location of the colored flower pot that is used for the hitbox and also for flowers to be planted in. Custom item frames are used instead of flower pots as block currently can not have custom data added to them.
